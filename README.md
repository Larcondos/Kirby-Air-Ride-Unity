# Kirby-Air-Ride-Unity
An attempt at cloning Kirby Air Ride for the Gamecube. 

Made over a few days as a project for school. Currently very bug ridden and computer dependent as to how well it wants to run.

Very barebones, but mostly a proof of concept.

Credit for nearly all of the textures goes to [Kilerbomb's HD Texture Pack](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-kirby-air-ride-hd-textures-v0-4-2-updated-wip)



# Known Bugs:
  1. Runs at different speeds on different computers
  2. Occasionally Kirby will randomly fall through the floor after jumping off a star
  3. Speedometer will occasionally not update correctly when switching machines.
    
# Usage
  I will only be including the files that run the game here, as uploading the whole project is way too large. While I permit for my code to be used under GNU license, Kirby and all respective trademarks belong to Nintendo.
